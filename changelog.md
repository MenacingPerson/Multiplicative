# Release 3.4.0

- Quilt has been removed...

Why? Because it's basically identical to fabric.

It's also slower to update. It hasn't updated to 1.20.2 yet.

This also presents me with 3 less versions to test than if I had kept quilt support for this release.

- 1.19.4 has been removed...

It was too old, anyway. So now:

- Added 1.20.2

It has been replaced with 1.20.2!

The next to go will be 1.20.1 once all pending mods update

- Shader support for forge

- Added an options.txt file

- The next release will have no 1.19.4 and hopefully no 1.20.1.

It will instead opt for only 1.20.2.

- A lot more mods

This is another thing I'm trying... if you don't like it, please join my discord and tell me.
