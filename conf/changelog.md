# Release 3.7.0

Updated fabric loader

"Sonance" has been renamed to "Sounds".

Flow may crash your game, if that occurs try deleting that mod

Quilt is probably dead. It has been dropped to reduce overhead.

1.20.1 is **deprecated** now. This means that:
- The quilt version is gone.
- Forge and fabric 1.20.1 are considered deprecated and not recommended for use (support will still be provided)
- Forge 1.20.2 awaits connnector in order to update
