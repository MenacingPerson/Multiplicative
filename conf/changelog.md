# Release 3.7.0

Updated fabric loader

Quilt is probably dead. It has been dropped to reduce overhead.

"Sonance" has been renamed to "Sounds".

Flow may crash your game, if that occurs try deleting that mod

1.20.1 is **deprecated** now. This means that:
- The quilt version is gone.
- Forge and fabric 1.20.1 are considered "deprecated" (support will still be provided)
- Forge 1.20.2 awaits connnector in order to update
- 1.20.1 will be removed when Connector updates
